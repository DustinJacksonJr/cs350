The project I sumbitted was milestone 2 is where the professor wanted us to control the red led light wiith a written command in the IDE. This really taught me how to use the terminal and connect it with a device.  I did particularly well with connecting to the right port which was com6 in my case,  I never had a problem connecting to the device to the terminal. I do have a lot improvements to make only because It took me forever to write the correct commands for the device to understand, but with a few hours of looking at some resources I as able to figure it out. The texas instrument website actually had the best resources for me to follow. I will be transferring these skills when it comes time to use an ebedded device, I know know how to program it efficiently.
